## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric cyan (#00E0FF) for highlights and interactive elements, symbolizing energy and innovation.
- Background color: Dark blue (#0A0F1F) for a sleek, futuristic dark theme.
- Accent color: Royal blue (#0078FF), an analogous hue to the primary, for secondary interactive elements. It will have reduced brightness and saturation compared to the primary color to provide sufficient contrast without distracting.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, computerized feel.
- Use glowing icons that match the overall electric, cybernetic aesthetic.
- Employ glassmorphism effects (rgba(255,255,255,0.05)) on card components with rounded corners, soft shadows, and inner glow for a modern, semi-transparent look.
- Implement fluid hover animations and subtle transitions using blur, gradient fades, or parallax scrolling to enhance user engagement.
