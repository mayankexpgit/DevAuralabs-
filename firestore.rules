/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for DevAura Labs platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-specific data (enrollments, website requests) while allowing public read access to course information. Administrative privileges are granted based on the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles.
 * - `/courses/{courseId}`: Stores course information (publicly readable).
 * - `/skills/{skillId}`: Stores skill development program information (publicly readable).
 * - `/users/{userId}/enrollments/{enrollmentId}`: Stores enrollment records for a specific user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/website_requests/{websiteRequestId}`: Stores website requests for a specific user.
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`: Indicates admin status.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only manage their own enrollments and website requests.
 * - Course and skill data is publicly readable but only writable by admins.
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Admin privileges are determined by the presence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - No denormalization is required as the security rules leverage path-based ownership and admin role checks, avoiding the need for extra `get()` calls.
